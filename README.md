This little program is an Hangman Game entirely coded in Golang.

To start the program write in the console: go run main.go
When you start the game, you need to choose the difficulty of the word.
To choose the difficulty you need to write 1, 2 or 3.

After that, you have 10 attempts to find the hidden word.
When you fail to find a letter the hangman start appearing.

You don't lose atempts if you write a letter already revealed, if you try not a letter, or if you try to retry a letter.
